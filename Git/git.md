### Top 10 Git Commands Every Developer Should Know

Git is an essential tool for version control and collaboration in software development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering these Git commands will significantly enhance your productivity and efficiency. Here are the top 10 most used Git commands that every developer should know:

## 1. git init
The git init command initializes a new Git repository. This command sets up the necessary files and directories for Git to start tracking changes in your project.

```
git init
```

## 2. git clone
The git clone command creates a copy of an existing repository. It's commonly used to download a project from a remote repository like GitHub to your local machine.

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

## 3. git add
The git add command stages changes from your working directory for the next commit. You can add individual files or all changes in the directory.

```
git add <file>
#to add all files
git add .
```

## 4. git commit
The git commit command saves your staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message. Each commit represents a checkpoint in your projectâ€™s history.

```
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## 5. git status
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes are staged, unstaged, and untracked.

```

## 7. git pull
The git pull command fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local repository. It combines the functionalities of git fetch and git merge.

```
