# Mastering Essential Command Line Tools: find, sed, awk, grep, ls

## Introduction
In the world of command line interfaces (CLI), mastering essential tools can significantly enhance your productivity and efficiency. This guide focuses on five powerful commands: find, sed, awk, grep, and ls. Each command serves distinct purposes, from searching and filtering to text processing and directory listing.

## 1. find
The find command searches for files and directories based on various criteria within a directory hierarchy.

### Basic Usage:

```
find /path/to/search -name "pattern"
```

### Flags and Use Cases:


- `-name "pattern"`: Search files by name pattern.
- `-type d or -type f`: Filter by directory (`d`) or regular file (`f`).
- `-exec command {} +`: Execute command on found files.
- `-mtime n`: Filter by file modification time (`n` days).

### Examples:

1. **Find all .txt files in the current directory and its subdirectories:**
   ```
   find . -name "*.txt"
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   ./file1.txt
   ./folder/file2.txt
   ```

2. **Find directories named "docs" in `/home/user`:**
   ```
   find /home/user -type d -name "docs"
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   /home/user/docs
   ```
3. **Find files modified in the last 7 days:**

   ```
   find . -mtime -7
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   ./file1.txt
   ./folder/file2.txt
   ```

 

## 2. sed
The `sed` command is used for text stream processing, allowing you to perform text transformations

### Basic Usage:

```
sed 's/pattern/replacement/g' filename
```

### Flags and Use Cases:

- `-e 'script'`: Specify multiple sed commands.
- `-i`: Edit files in-place (make sure to backup important files).
- `-n`: Suppress automatic printing of pattern space.

### Examples:

1. **Replace "apple" with "orange" in file.txt and save changes:**

    ```
    # Before
    **$ cat file.txt**
    This is an apple.
    ```
    ```
    sed -i 's/apple/orange/g' file.txt
    # After
    **$ cat file.txt**
    This is an orange.
    ```
2. **Delete lines containing "pattern" from `file.txt`:**

    ```
    # Before
    $ cat file.txt
    Line 1 with pattern
    Line 2 without pattern
    ```
    
    ```
    sed -i '/pattern/d' file.txt
    # After
    $ cat file.txt
    Line 2 without pattern
    ```

## 3. awk
awk is a powerful pattern scanning and processing language for text files.

### Basic Usage:

```
awk '/pattern/ {print $1}' filename
```

### Flags and Use Cases:


- `-F delimiter`:Specify field separator (default is whitespace).
- `-v var=value`: Assign variables for use in the awk script.
- `BEGIN` and `END` blocks: Actions to perform before processing starts and after processing ends.

### Examples:

1. **Print the first column of lines containing "error" in log.txt:**
    ```
    # Before
    $ cat log.txt
    error 123
    success 456
    error 789
    ```
    ```
    awk '/error/ {print $1}' log.txt
    # Output
    error
    error
    ```
2. Print all lines longer than 80 characters in `file.txt`:
   ```
   # Before
   $ cat file.txt
   Line 1 with more than 80 characters 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890
   Line 2 shorter
   ```
   ```
   awk 'length($0) > 80' file.txt
   # Output
   Line 1 with more than 80 characters 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890
   ```

## 4. grep
The `grep` command searches for patterns in files and outputs matching lines

### Basic Usage:

```
grep "pattern" filename
```

### Flags and Use Cases:


- `-i`: Ignore case distinctions in the pattern.
- `-r`: Recursively search directories.
- `-n`: Show line numbers.


### Examples:

1. **Search for "error" in all files in the current directory:**
   ```
   # Before
   $ cat file1.txt
   This line has an error.
   $ cat file2.txt
   No errors here.
   ```
   ```
   grep -r "error" .
   # Output
   file1.txt:This line has an error.
   ```
2. **Search for "pattern" case insensitively in file.txt:**
   ```
   # Before
   $ cat file.txt
   Pattern found
   No Pattern found
   ```
   ```
   grep -i "pattern" file.txt
   # Output
   Pattern found
   ```

## 5. ls
The ls command lists directory contents.

### Basic Usage:

```
ls /path/to/directory
```

### Flags and Use Cases:

- `-l`: Long format listing.
- `-a`: Include hidden files.
- `-t`: Sort by time modified.


### Examples:

1. List all files (including hidden) in long format in the current directory:
   ```
   $ ls -la
   # Output
   drwxr-xr-x  2 user group  4096 Jun 26 10:00 .
   drwxr-xr-x 10 user group  4096 Jun 20 12:00 ..
   -rw-r--r--  1 user group   100 Jun 25 14:30 file1.txt
   -rw-r--r--  1 user group   200 Jun 24 09:45 .hiddenfile
   ```
2. List directories only in /home/user:
   ```
   $ ls -l /home/user | grep '^d'
   # Output
   drwxr-xr-x  2 user group  4096 Jun 25 16:00 docs
   drwxr-xr-x  3 user group  4096 Jun 24 11:30 pictures
   ```
